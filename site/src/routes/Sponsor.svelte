  <h3>Help me keep developing and sharing this Open Source Game</h3>

  <p class="narrow">
    Many nights and weekends went into the current version of the game.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love sharing it with others so they can enjoy it and learn how games are developed.
    <br>
    <br>
    I am asking for your support to keep the game server running and be able to invest more time.
